# Depot.nvim

A plugin to load project local settings into a local store.

Unlike other plugins like [nvim-config-local](https://github.com/klen/nvim-config-local) no code is executed. Rather, a
configuration table is loaded into a global store and can be consumed throughout your config.

Have your config read your settings, rather than the settings modify your config.
